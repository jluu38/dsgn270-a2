# Green Washing

Greenwashing, also called **green sheen**, is a form of marketing spin in which green PR (green values) and green marketing are deceptively used to persuade the public that an organization's products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly.

## Terminology

The term *greenwashing* was coined by New York environmentalist Jay Westervelt in a 1986 essay regarding the hotel industry's practice of placing placards in each room promoting reuse of towels ostensibly to "save the environment." Westervelt noted in most cases, little or no effort toward reducing energy waste was being made by these institutionsâ€”as evidenced by the lack of cost reduction this practice effected.  Westervelt thus labeled this and other outwardly environmentally conscientious acts with a greater, underlying purpose of profit increase as greenwashing.

[Home and Family Edition](http://faculty.wwu.edu/dunnc3/rprnts.TheSinsofGreenwashing2010.pdf) describes seven sins of greenwashing:

1. **Sin of the Hidden Trade-off**, committed by suggesting a product is "green" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other important environmental issues.
2. **Sin of No Proof**, committed by an environmental claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible supporting information or by a reliable third-party certification.
3. **Sin of Vagueness**, committed by every claim that is so poorly defined or broad that its real meaning is likely to be misunderstood by the consumer.
4. **Sin of Worshiping False Labels** is committed when a claim, communicated either through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party endorsement where no such endorsement exists.
5. **Sin of Irrelevance**, committed by making an environmental claim that may be truthful but which is unimportant or unhelpful for consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.
6. **Sin of Lesser of Two Evils**, committed by claims that may be true within the product category, but that risk distracting consumers from the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole.
7. **Sin of Fibbing**, the least frequent Sin, is committed by making environmental claims that are simply false.

## Examples of Greenwashing

- **The Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change** (Tempe, Arizona) is funded by the coal industry.
- **The conversion of the term *Tar Sands* to *Oil Sands*** (Alberta, Canada) in corporate and political language.
  - This semantic shift can be seen as a case of greenwashing in an attempt at countering growing public concern as to the environmental and health impacts of the industry.
- In Germany, **European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)** mistakenly suggests by its name that it is an important scientific research institution. EIKE is **a lobby organization** that neither has an office nor employs climate scientists, but instead **disseminates fake news on climate issues on its website**.
- In response to increased calls for banning plastic straws, **Starbucks introduced a new straw-less lid that actually contained more plastic** by weight than the old straw and lid combination.
- An [article](https://www.wired.com/2008/10/st-greenmarketing/) in *Wired* magazine alleges that **slogans are used to suggest environmentally benign business activity**.
  - The Comcast Ecobill has the slogan "PaperLESSisMORE", but **Comcast uses large amounts of paper for direct marketing**.
  - The Airbus A380 airliner is described as "A better environment inside and out" even though **air travel has a high negative environment cost**.
